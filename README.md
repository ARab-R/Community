# Community
This is the main repository for the community where all meeting notes are added.

We use the following tools for our community:
- Notion to discuss and polish our ideas/thoughts 
- Keybase to store all credentials 
- Tinyletter for our newsletter 
- GitHub for all source codes. Everything is open-source. 
- [Zenodo Community](https://zenodo.org/communities/arabr/?page=1&size=20) to create a DOI for all talks and contributions
